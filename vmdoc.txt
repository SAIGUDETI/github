Server Migration in AWS 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The movement of VMs from one resource to another, such as from one physical host to another physical host, or data store 
to data store, is known as VM migration. There are two types of VM migration: cold and live. Cold migration occurs when
the VM is shut down. Live migration occurs while the VM is actually running.

ova and ovf:
An Open Virtualization Application/Appliance (OVA) file is a single file that archives all the files that make up an OVA. 

OVF packages contain a series of uncompressed files that make it easier to access individual disk images in the file. 
OVA packages are just one large file. While you can compress this file, it doesn't have the flexibility of a
series of files like OVF.

First create a VM in VMware workstation like CentOS 7 64-bit

1.First create OVA file from VMWARE Workstation (Guest Host)
2.Then copy the OVA file into S3 bucket in a Region (ap-south-1)
3.Now create a user account in IAM With admin access rights and login through aws CLI 
4.Now Run the bellow commands one by one then finaly check the aim Image status in ec2 Service
5. Now to launch the EC2 instance using my IAM 



aws iam create-role --role-name vmimport --assume-role-policy-document "file://C:/vmmigration//trust-policy.json"


aws iam put-role-policy --role-name vmimport --policy-name vmimport --policy-document "file://C:/vmmigration//role-policy.json"


aws ec2 import-image --description "CentOS 7.ova" --disk-containers "file://C:/vmmigration//containers.json"

How to check new ami id form CLI:

aws ec2 describe-import-images-tasks --import-task-ids --import-ami-<AMI ID>
